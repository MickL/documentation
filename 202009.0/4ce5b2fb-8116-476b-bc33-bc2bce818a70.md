The *Product* feature allows creating products, manage their characteristics and settings.

In Spryker Commerce OS, you create and manage products in the [Back Office](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/general-back-office-overview). The product information you specify serves multiple purposes:

* Defines product characteristics.
* Affects shop behavior. For example, filtering and search on the Storefront is based on product attributes. 
* It's used for internal calculations, like delivery costs based on the product weight.


## Abstract products and product variants

A product can have multiple variants, such as size or color. Such product variations are called *product variants*, or *concrete products*. To distinguish product versions, track their stock, and provide a better shopping experience, product variants are grouped under *abstract products*. 

The abstract product is the highest level of the product hierarchy. It does not have its own stock, but defines the properties shared by its product variants. A product variant always belongs to one abstract product, has a distinctive stock, and is always different from another product variant with at least one [super product attribute](#super-product-attributes).

The following table shows the differences between abstract products and product variants:

| Product data | Abstract product | Product variant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SKU | v | v |
| Name | v | v |
| Description | v | v |
| Product attributes | v | v |
| Super attributes |  | v |
| Media assets | v | v |
| Stock |  | v |

### Abstract products and product variants on the Storefront

On the Storefront, only abstract products are displayed in the product catalog and can be searched for. 

Product variants are always a part of an abstract product. Abstract product and all its product variants share the same URL.

The example on the following diagram shows the realtions between abstract products and product variants on the Storefront.

![image](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Product+Management/Product+Abstraction/product-abstraction.png)

In this example, a T-shirt, which is an abstract product, is available in sizes S, M, and L, which are three different product variants, each having its own stock. When you search *T-shirt* on the Storefront, it's the abstract product that appears as the search result. A Storefront user can only buy one of the product variants. On the *Product details* page of the abstract product, they select and add to cart one of the product variants: S, M, L. 


### Product information inheritance

Information of a concreete product on the Storefront is a combination of the information of the concrete product and its abstract  product.  

The information of a concrete product always overwrites the information of its abstract product. For example, if the abstract product name is *VGA cable*, and the concrete product name is *VGA cable(1.5m)*, the latter is displayed. 
If some information is not specified for a concrete product, it inherits the information from its abstract product. For example, if no price is specified for a concrete product, the price of its abstract product is displayed. 

Check the use cases below to better understand how abstract and concrete porducts are processed in a shop.

#### Case 1: Selling books

Most of the time, books do not have variations. In this case, you create an abstract product and a concrete product per book. The abstract product holds all the information about the product. The concrete product holds the stock information.

#### Case 2: Selling blue and green products

To sell a product in blue and green colors, you create an abstract product and two concrete products. To let your customers select the product variant of which color they want to buy, you create a `color` super attribute. 

Suppose the green variant is more expensive than the blue one. In this case, you add the price to the green product variant. The blue variant inherits the price from the abtract product. 

The product information is structured as follows:
* The abstract product contains all the information about the product.
* The concrete products contain the following information:
    * The blue variant holds the stock information and the super attribute: `color = blue`.
    * The green variant holds:
        *  The stock information.
        *  The super attribute: `color = green`,
        *  The price, which is different from the abstract product's price.

#### Case 3: Selling a product in five colors, four sizes, and three materials

To a product in five colors, four sizes, and three materials, you can structure product information in one of the following ways. You can create an abstract product and up to 60 variants to support all the combinations. Or, you can use the [Product Groups](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/product-group-feature-overview) feature. 

Using the Product Group feature, you create a group of five abstract products, one for each color. Each abstract product  contains up to 12 concrete products of different combinations of the sizes and the materials.

The abstract products contain all the information about the product. The product variants hold the stock information and the super attribute of color, size, and material.


## Product attributes

A *product attribute* is a characteristic of a product that consists of a name and value. For example, in the attribute `color = white`, `color` is the attribute name, and `white` is the attribute value.

You can create characteristic attributes for products, like brand or special features. You can define specific values to help you and your customers distinguish between products. You can assign multiple attributes to products to simplify the filter and category functions. 


A Back Office user can [create product attributes](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-product-attribute).

A developer can import [product attributes](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-product-management-attributecsv) and [super attributes](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-product-attribute-keycsv). 


### Product attribute inheritance 

A Back Office user can add product attributes to abstract and concrete products. If they add a product attribute to an abstract product, it is added to all its concrete products. If they add it to a concrete product, it's not added to the other concrete products. 


### Declared attributes
A declared attribute is an attribute that was [created](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-product-attribute) or [imported](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-product-management-attributecsv).

After declaring an attribute, Back Office users can add it to products, and developers can import products with it. 

:::(Warning) (Undeclared attributes)
If a developer imports products with undeclared attributes, Back Office users cannot manage them. We recommend declaring all the attributes you are going to use. 
:::

### Super attributes
The Spryker Commerce OS product data model allows creating multiple variants of a product. For a shop to distinguish different product variants, some of their characteristics should be differerent. A product attribute that distinguishes one product variant from another is a *super attribute*. 

For a product variant to be selectable on the Storefront, a value of one of its product attributes should be unique compared to the product attribute values of other variants of the same abstract product. 

When creating a product attribute, a Back Office user selectes if it is a super attribute. 

Product variants of the same abstract product can differ by different super attributes. Check the following super attribute examples:

1. Abstract product X has concrete products A and B: 
    * A: `color = blue` 
    * B: `color = green`

2. Abstract product Y has concrete products C and D: 
    * C:  `color = red`
    * D:  `size = 45`
    







### Predefined product attribute values
A *predefined product attribute value* is a product attribute value that a Back Office user defines when managing product attributes. 

A Back Office user can configure configure a product attribute to accept only predefined values. In this case, when [defining the attribute value during product management](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-products#managing-product-attributes), they choose from the predefined values. Otherwise, they can enter any value for the attribute. 

### Product attribute translations
A Back Office user can localize product attributes. They can add translations for attribute names and values. For example, in the attribute `Color = White`, both `Color` and `White` can be localized. 

There are different ways to handle translations of attributes. See the examples below.

#### Example 1: localized attributes and non-localized values

In a shop with German and English languages, product Y has the `weight` attribute name with the `63.5 g` value. We want to translate only the attribute name.

We localize the key as follows:
* en_EN: `Weight`
* de_DE: `Gewicht`

The attribute value `63.5 g` is not localized.

As a result, the following is displayed on the Storefront:
* English version of the shop: Weight = 63.5 g 
* German version of the shop: Gewicht = 63.5 g  

#### Example 2: localized attributes and values
  In a shop with two languages Product X exists with an attribute `Protection Feature` and an attribute value `waterproof`. 
  
We localize them as follows:
* Attribute key:
    * en_EN: `Protection Feature`
    * de_DE: `Schutzfunktion` 
* Attribute value:
    * en_EN: `Waterproof` 
    * de_DE: `Wasserdicht` 

As a result, the following is displayed on the Storefront:
* English version of the shop: Protection Feature = Waterproof 
* German version of the shop: Schutzfunktion = Wasserdicht  

#### Example 3: different localized attributes and values for different languages

Product Z has the `length` attribute and is sold in 3 countries: Germany, Ireland, and the US. Since the US does not use the metric system, in the US, we want to display the attribute values in feet. In Germany and Ireland, we want to display the values in meteres.

There are two ways to handle this:
* Add a non-localized attribute key for Germany and Ireland, and a localized key for the US. Two languages can share the same translation for the attribute, like in the [Example 1](#example-1-localized-attributes-and-non-localized-values).
* Add localized attribute keys and values for each language. 

##### Non-localized key and localized key for the US
In the DB, the `attribute.length` key is saved for non-localized values, and a localized key `attribute.length.us` is saved for the translations in the metric system: 

We localize two attribute keys:
* Key = attribute.length 
    * Value (en_IE) = Length 
    * Value (de_DE) = Länge 
* Key = attribute.length.us 
    * Value (en_US) = Length 



For the key `attribute.length` the value is `1.5 meter`. For the key `attribute.length.us` the value is `4.92 feet`.

##### Localized keys for US, DE and IE 

In the DB, the following localized keys are saved: `attribute.length.de`, `attribute.length.ie`, and `attribute.length.us`.


* Key = attribute.length.de 
* Value (de_DE) = Länge 

* Key = attribute.length.ie 
* Value (en_IE) = Length 

* Key = attribute.length.us 
* Value (en_US) = Length 

Now for each of the attribute keys we add the attribute values. 

For the key “attribute.length.de” the value is `1.5 meter`.

For the key “attribute.length.ie” the value is: 
Value = 1.5 meter 

For the key “attribute.length.us” the value is: 
Value = 4.92 feet 

What you see on the Irish and German versions of the shop: 
Length = 1.5 meter 
Länge = 1.5 meter 

What you see on the US version of the shop: 
Length = 4.92 feet

## Managing product information in a third-party product information management system
Besides the Back Office, you can maintain product information in an external Product Information Management (PIM) system. The data from the PIM systems can be exported to Spryker. An import interface transforms the incoming product data into a Spryker specific data structure and persists it. After that, the data is exported to Redis and Elasticsearch. This way, the Storefront can access the relevant product data very fast. After the import was finished, you can access the products in the Spryker Back Office.

![Product information management](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Product+Management/Product/product_information_management.png)

The Spryker Commerce OS supports integration of the following PIM systems:

* [Akeneo](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/core-extension)
* [Censhare PIM](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/censhare-pim)
* [Xentral](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/xentral)





## Current Constraints

Currently, the feature has the following functional constraints which are going to be resolved in the future.

* When adding a product variant to an existing abstract product, you can only use the existing super attributes.

* To add another super attribute to variants, you need to recreate the abstract product with its concrete products from scratch.

* If you import a product without defining its attributes, you cannot edit the attributes in the Back Office.

@(Warning)()(We recommend defining all the atributes you want to use.)
