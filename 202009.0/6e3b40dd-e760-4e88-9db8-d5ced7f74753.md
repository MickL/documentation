The *Customer Account Management* feature allows customers to save and quickly access the following information on the Storefront:

* Contact details
* Addresses
* Order history
* Preferences, such as language and shipping options

There are slight differences in customer accounts' information for the B2B and B2C shops. The following table describes such differences and similarities:

| Customer Account sections | B2B Shop | B2C Shop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | ✓ | ✓|
| Profile | ✓ | ✓ |
| Addresses | ✓ | ✓ |
| Order History | ✓ | ✓ |
| Newsletter | ✓ | ✓ |
| Shopping Lists | ✓ |  |
| Shopping Carts | ✓ |  |
| Wishlist |  | ✓ |

See [Customer Registration feature overview](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/customer-registration-feature-overview) for details on how customer accounts can be created.

:::(Info) ()
Customers can manage their accounts directly on the Storefront side. If updates are done by a customer, the data is synchronized, and the Back Office user sees the relevant information in the **Back Office > Customers > Customers** section. The exceptions are newsletter subscription and password change, as this information is not stored in the Back Office.
:::

To comply with international regulations, customer account can be deleted by request from the customer. Shop owners can also delete a customer account through the Back Office.

:::(Warning) ()
Deleting a customer does not affect billing and order-related information. Deleting an account anonymizes customer information and address data. By default, customer email addresses are anonymized, making it possible for customers to return and re-register with a completely new account.
:::

The Customer Account Management feature in the Back Office ensures the following functionality:

* Adding notes attached for customers
* Setting a preferred locale per customer
* Deleting customer data via an anonymization mechanism
* Configuring non-linear customer reference for external communication
* Setting address books with default addresses for billing and shipping
* Sending password token through email
* Checking last orders in a shop

See [Managing customers](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-customers) for details.
