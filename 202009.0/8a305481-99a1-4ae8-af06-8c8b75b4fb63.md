The default filter functionality allows you to use *standard filters* and *dynamic filters and facers*.

## Standard filters

Standard filters help buyers find the products they look for in the catalog.

With the standard filters, they can filter the products according to the specified price range, product ratings, product labels, color, material, brand, etc.

There as the following standard filter types:

* *Single-select*: allows a user to select only one filter option.

* *Multi-select*: allows a user to select several variants simultaneously.

* *Range*: filters data in the dimension from the maximum and minimum value. In the Spryker Demo Shop, the range filter is applied to the abstract product prices.

Products appropriate for the active filters are displayed in the results.

## Dynamic filters and facets

You can define facet filters for any product attribute. The design, placement on page, quantity of filters, content and order criteria by which they are listed in your shop, are completely customizable. Apart from the standard filters, there are others that make use of a product's metadata to create additional and more advanced filter options. For example, the *New* product indication that allows you to display items that were added to your catalog recently.

- Every product attribute can be used as a filter
- Different filter types: single- and multi-select, and range filter

See [Managing filter preferences](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-filter-preferences) for details on how to configure the filter preferences in the Back Office. 

## Current constraints
Price Range Filter is not supported with the Merchant Relations, that is why this filter is not included in the B2B demo shop. However, in [the B2C demo shop](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/b2c-suite), you can still filter the products using the price range filter.
