Sometimes, after experimenting or getting unexpected behavior from the docker/sdk up command, it may be useful to reset the entire Docker environment and start from scratch. 

:::(Warning) (Data removal)
By following the instructions below, you remove all the Docker data. 
:::

To reset a Docker environment:

1. Delete all containers, networks, unused images, and build cache:
```bash
sudo docker system prune
```
2. In the project root directory, clean data, bootstrap the deploy file and start the instance:
```bash
docker/sdk clean-data && docker/sdk boot {deploy_file_name} && docker/sdk up
```

Youâ€™ve restarted your instance from scratch.
