If a concrete product ran out of stock, it is tagged as out of stock and cannot be added to cart:

Once the stock is updated with a positive number, the concrete product becomes available for purchase.

A *discontinued product* is a product which is no longer produced by its manufacturer. The discontinued product may have positive or negative stock.

When a Back Office user discountinues a product, they can define the date until which the product is displayed in the shop. Discontinued products have a certain period of time when they will still be shown on the website (active_until). This may be usefule, for example, when a product was discontinued but it's still in stock in the shop. On the define date, the product becomes inactive. 

@(Warning)()(Only [concrete products](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/product-abstraction#abstract-and-concrete-products--variants-) can become discontinued.)

The schema below illustrates the relations between discontinued products, abstract and concrete products:
