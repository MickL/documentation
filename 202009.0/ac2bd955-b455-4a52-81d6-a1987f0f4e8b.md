This article describes the default Spryker search.

## Full-site search

* *Auto-completion*: Helps customers by predicting the rest of a search string and offers a list of matching options. 
* *Search suggestions*: Proposes on-the-fly page suggestions for products, categories or CMS Pages.
* *Did-you-mean*: Offers typo corrections for the search string.
* *Mimic a dynamic category* by saving a search result and embedding it like a category page in your navigation.

## Multi-language search
If you set up a multi-language store, the search function automatically checks and adjusts the language your customer has selected. All search functions, such as auto-complete or auto-suggest, are then applied to the selected language.

## Textual search
By default, all content on CMS and Product Pages, such as product name, description text or allocated attributes, is searchable. Additionally, Product Attributes and can be boosted in the search results. You can easily define which products or content should be included into or excluded from the full text search.
