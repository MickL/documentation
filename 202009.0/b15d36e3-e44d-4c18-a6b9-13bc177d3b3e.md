Control the values of the orders your customers place by defining order thresholds. 

Fulfilling small orders is not always worthwhile for the business, as operating costs, time, and effort spent on processing them often overweight the profit gained. In such cases, implementing a minimum threshold might be the solution. The *Order Thresholds* feature provides you with multiple options of defining thresholds. You can define a minimum threshold and disallow placing orders with smaller values or request customers to pay a fee.

Per your business requirements, you can also set up a maximum threshold to disallow placing orders above a defined threshold.

In a B2B scenario, you can define any type of threshold for each [merchant relation](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/merchants-and-merchant-relations-overview) separately.

With the *Order Thresholds* feature, you can:

* Get buyers to place bigger orders, which can increase your sales
* Prevent waste of resources on small orders
* Ensure that the cost of items sold is not too high for each transaction, which, in the long run, can make your business more profitable
* Support promotional campaigns, for example, by offering free shipping for orders above a threshold
