If Spryker Virtual Machine gets stuck at the *Configuring and enabling network interfaces* message during start up, do the following:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` twice to stop the VM start up process.

2. Execute the `vagrant halt` command to stop the VM.

3. Start the virtual machine again with *vagrant up*.

@(Info)()(If you get a message that the machine is already running, end all processes related to *Vagrant*, *Virtualbox* and *Ruby*. Then try again.)

4. If the start up process halts again with the same message, delete all virtual network interfaces in **Virtualbox** and restart the VM again.

@(Info)()(The interfaces will be re-created automatically.)
