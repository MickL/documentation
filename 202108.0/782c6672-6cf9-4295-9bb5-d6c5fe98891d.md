To create a new custom scheduler:

1. Create a reader plugin that reads configuration of jobs from the specific source.
2. Create an adapter plugin that covers the basic scheduler functionality.
3. Enable plugins in `\Pyz\Zed\Scheduler\SchedulerDependencyProvider` and adjust configuration settings according to your changes.
