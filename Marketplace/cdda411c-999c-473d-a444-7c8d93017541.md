When viewed independently of each other, the Marketplace and Merchant State Machines workflows look like this:

In this article, we'll look into the process of how Marketplace and Merchant State Machines work together and check what statuses are displayed in the Back Office to a Marketplace Administrator, in the Merchant Portal to the merchant and in the customer account to a buyer in the Storefront respectfully.

## Order item’s status progress: New
The process starts when the customer places an order. The Marketplace order obtains state *New*.
![State: New](https://confluence-connect.gliffy.net/embed/image/630bbd7b-66ee-475f-9d79-50a258b994b2.png?utm_medium=live&utm_source=custom){height="" width=""}

The table below provides an overview of the statuses that are displayed at this step:

| ROLE | APPLICATION | STATUS |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Marketplace Administrator | Back Office     | New                  |
| Merchant                  | Merchant Portal | N/A                  |
| Customer                  | Storefront      | Confirmed / Accepted |

## Order item’s status progress: Paid
Once the Marketplace Administrator receives the payment, the state in the marketplace order item moves to *Paid*. The event could be triggered automatically when the payment was done in the marketplace system, or the payment confirmation is uploaded with data importers or manually in other circumstances.

The table below provides an overview of the statuses that are displayed at this step:

| ROLE   | APPLICATION | STATUS  |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| Marketplace Administrator | Back Office     | Paid   |
| Merchant                  | Merchant Portal | N/A         |
| Customer                  | Storefront      | In Progress |

## Order item’s status progress: Canceled
After the payment has been made, the customer can still cancel the order during the period outlined by the Marketplace policies. The Marketplace provides the customer with a button on the Storefront to carry out that action. When the customer cancels the order, the state of the marketplace order item moves to *Canceled*. 
:::(Warning) (Note)
The Marketplace Administrator can also cancel the order under exceptional circumstances.

| Customer                  | Storefront      | Canceled   |

## Order item’s status progress: Refunded
When the order is canceled after the payment has been made, the Marketplace Administrator has to refund the payment for the canceled order to the customer in full or partially. When the refund is completed, the state of the marketplace order item moves to *Refunded*. After issuing the refund, the Marketplace policies set time to elapse before the state of the order is automatically transferred to *Closed*.

| Customer                  | Storefront      | Refunded   |

## Order item’s status progress: Sent to Merchant
When the system has payment confirmation, it performs the operations to split the marketplace order into one or several merchant orders. The state of the marketplace order item moves to *Sent to Merchant*. The merchant orders are created, and each of the items that they contain shows a state according to each Merchant’s state machine. The first state is *New*.

## Order item’s status progress: Canceled by Merchant
Merchant can cancel the order for various reasons. The state of the merchant order Item, in this case, will change to *Canceled* by merchant. The Marketplace Administrator also sees the updated state in the Back Office.

| Customer    | Storefront      | Canceled    |

## Order Item’s Status Progress: Shipped by Merchant
The merchant ships the item to the customer address. To input this information on Merchant Portal, the merchant triggers the event manually (**Shipped** action button) or through the import of the new state via a CSV file. The item’s state on the Merchant State Machine moves to *Shipped*. The Marketplace Administrator also needs to make use of this info. They need to see that the item was also shipped in the Marketplace State Machine.

| Customer  | Storefront   | Shipped Expected by \<date\> |

## Order item’s status progress: Delivered
After the shipment, the merchant tracks the delivery with the shipment carrier. When the item is delivered, the carrier notifies the merchant. The merchant triggers the event Deliver manually (**Delivered** action button) or automatically by uploading a CSV with the new state to the Merchant Portal. The Marketplace Administrator also needs to be aware of this information. The state is also updated on the Marketplace State Machine.

| Customer                  | Storefront      | Delivered on \<date\> |

## Order item’s status progress: Closed
Marketplace applies a series of policies that allow customers to return items during a given period of time. When that period expires, the marketplace order item is moved to *Closed*. The Merchant Administrator must also be aware of that expiration, and the state closed is also used on the Merchant State Machine for the item.
