*Inventory Management* refers to warehousing and managing your storeâ€™s stock. In this context, the warehouse is the physical place where your products are stored, and stock is the number of products available in the warehouse. See [Warehouse management](#warehouse-management) and Stock management for details on how to manage them.
Stock does not always reflect the real availability of products, as not all the items available in stock are available for sale. For example, if items are reserved, that is, there are pending orders with these items, they can not be ordered, even though physically, they are still in stock. The value that reflects the difference between the current quantity of products in stock and the quantity of these products in the pending orders, is referred to as the availability of products. The availability is calculated per store. See Availability management for details on how to manage availability.

## Warehouse management

You can [create warehouses in the Back Office](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-warehouse) or [import them](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-warehousecsv).

A warehouse can be assigned to a single store or shared between several stores. See [Managing stocks in a multi-store environment: Best practices](https://documentation.spryker.com/upcoming-release/docs/managing-stocks-in-a-multi-store-environment-best-practices) for the warehouse and stock management scenarios you can set up for your project. You can manage relations between stores and warehouses in the Back Office or by importing the warehouse and store data. See [Managing warehouses](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-warehouses#managing-warehouses) for details on how you can manage warehouses and stores in the back office and [File details: warehouse_store.csv](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/file-details-warehouse-storecsv) on how you can import the warehouse and store data.

### Defining a warehouse address
You can define the warehouse address that will be used as the shipping origin address by importing the warehouse address data. See [File details: warehouse_address.csv](https://documentation.spryker.com/upcoming-release/docs/file-details-warehouse-addresscsv) for details about the import file.

## Stock management

When order is made, stock is not updated automatically in the system, you have to set it manually. You can define stock only for concrete products. You can set stock by:

* Editing product stock in the Back Office. See [Editing stock](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-products-availability#editing-stock) for details.
* Importing the quantities of items stored in each of the warehouses. See [Stocks](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/stocks) for details.

## Availability management

In contrast to stock, availability considers not just the number of products in the warehouse but also current open orders. 

When a buyer places an order, the products in the order become *reserved*, and the product availability changes. The changes are reflected in the Back Office: The availability is equal to the stock before the order is placed, and after the order is placed, the availability decreases, but the stock remains the same.

Product availability before the order:

Product availability after the order:

See [Checking availability](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-products-availability#checking-availability) for details on how you can check product availability in the Back Office.

:::(Info) ()
Availability of a product bundle is defined by the availability of each product in the bundle. If at least one of them is out of stock, the entire bundle is unavailable.

In the [state machine](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/order-process-modelling-state-machines), a developer can use the `reserved` parameter to define the states at which the order items are reserved. There can also be states that release an item. For example, when payment fails and order is canceled, the item is not reserved anymore:
