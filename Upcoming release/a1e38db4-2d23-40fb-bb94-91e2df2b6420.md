Sell different types of products and enable your users to order exactly what they want with the *Configurable Product* feature.

The feature allows you to sell complex products with modular designs or services. For example, if you sell clothes, you can allow your customers to define the material, color, and add their name to the product. Or, if you are selling a service, you can allow them to select a preferred date and time of the service delivery.

Being able to configure products, customers order exactly what they want without additional communication with support. This optimizes the buying process and reduces the time of order processing.

The feature helps you to:

*   Enable complex buying scenarios
*   Allow your customers to order exactly what they want
*   Optimize the buying process
*   Sell services
